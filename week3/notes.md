# Lecture 5  

## Population Projection with Migration   
- Migration is a continuous event  
- Expereince same demographic phenomena that the rest of pop does  

## So far all methods have been for one sex  
- Can add sexes like they are new age groups  
- completely deterministic  

## Modeling ASR  
- Modeling fills in missing info  
    - could be due to bad or no VR  
    - could be due to being in the future  
- we tend to always know something about $~_5q_0$  
- we sometimes know something about $~_{45}q_{15}$  
- helps us to  
    - generate age specific  
    - track outlier data  

## how do we do it?  
- Parametric models  
- Modle life tables  
- Lee Carter  

## Para models  
- Gompertz  
- Silder  
- HP  

## Modle Life Tables  
- Coale-Demeny life tables  
- Brass relational model  
    - semi parametric  
    - generates family of life tables from two parameters $\alpha$ & $\beta$
